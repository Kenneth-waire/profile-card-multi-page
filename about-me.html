            <h3>Areas of low confidence</h3>
            <p>One of the areas that really still bothers me is the fact that i am still in the process of learning react and i wouldnt
               even say i am yet a beginer, talk less of an amatuer. i really need to pull myself together on actully take time to critically
               think on how to solve problems before going to materials.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>still new to react</li>
                <li> still have not had lots of live projects</li>
                <li>still new to react, thats a scary part.</li>

            <h3>A future note</h3>
            <P> if there is one this the current me is finding difficult, its to believe i can actually do this... theres so many good reasons to
                give up. But there are better reasons to keep going, so no matter what, even if youre kicked out of HNG(lol), dont stop
                moving in any aspect of life.("am proud of you").
            </P>

        <section data-testid="test-about-extra" class="about-extra" >
            <h3>Extra toughts</h3>
            <p>i think ths HNG internship is actually awesome because it gives the oppourtunity to so many people to practise and sharpen their skills 
                with real life pressure and urgency. the only sad part is once you dont keep up, youre just taken out all toghther.
                i would want that to change, if it could, just keep the guys who dont do well in a seperate side, but at least let them keep learning and connecting.
